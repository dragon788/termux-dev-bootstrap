# Termux for development

Some people are gluttons for punishment, or really like to use one device for EVERYTHING...
For those people Chromebooks are wonderful.

Install Termux, install Termux:Style if you want the option for prettier fonts.
Examine bootstrap.sh with `cat bootstrap.sh` make changes if you want by installing vim/emacs/nano.
Run with `./bootstrap.sh`.
If certain things like `termux-setup-storage` don't trigger a new `storage` folder to show up with links to the standard Android folders, run it manually.
